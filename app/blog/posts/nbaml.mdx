Player performance prediction is a crucial aspect of **basketball analytics**. By leveraging **machine learning**, we can analyze historical player stats and predict their future performance, helping teams make data-driven decisions.

## **Dataset and Features**
We'll use **NBA player statistics** from public sources such as Kaggle or the NBA API. The dataset contains key features like:

- Points per game (PPG)
- Assists per game (APG)
- Rebounds per game (RPG)
- Shooting percentages (FG%, 3P%)
- Turnovers per game (TOV)
- Defensive stats (blocks, steals)

## **Building the Prediction Model**
We'll use **Python** along with `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `Matplotlib` to preprocess the data and build a machine learning model.

### **1. Load and Preprocess the Data**
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("nba_player_stats.csv")

# Select relevant features
features = ["PPG", "APG", "RPG", "FG%", "3P%", "TOV", "STL", "BLK"]
X = data[features]
y = data["Next_Season_PPG"]

# Split into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### **2. Train the Machine Learning Model**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Scale the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```

### **3. Make Predictions and Evaluate**
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

predictions = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Mean Absolute Error: {mae}")
```

## **Conclusion**
This **machine learning model** helps predict player performance, aiding in team decisions and fantasy basketball strategies. By integrating more advanced models, we can refine predictions and provide deeper insights into player development.

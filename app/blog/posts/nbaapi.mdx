In the world of sports analytics, access to reliable and up-to-date data is crucial for making informed decisions. The **NBA.com API** serves as a valuable source of game statistics, player performance metrics, and historical data. 

This article explores how to scrape data from the NBA.com API and store it efficiently in a database for further analysis.

## Understanding the NBA.com API

The **NBA.com API** provides structured data about teams, players, and games. While the API is not officially documented, developers often rely on network requests and third-party libraries to fetch data.

To get started, we'll use **Python** and the `requests` library to access the API endpoints.

## Fetching Data from NBA.com API

To retrieve data, we first need to identify the API endpoints. Here’s how to fetch live game data using Python:

```python
import requests
import json

url = "https://stats.nba.com/stats/scoreboardv2"
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0",
    "Accept": "application/json"
}
params = {
    "GameDate": "2024-01-29",
    "LeagueID": "00",
    "DayOffset": "0"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
data = response.json()
print(json.dumps(data, indent=4))
```

This script sends a request to the **NBA.com API**, retrieves JSON data, and prints it in a readable format.

## Storing Data in a Database

Once we have the JSON data, we need to store it in a database for analysis. **PostgreSQL** or **SQLite** are great options for structured data storage.

### Setting Up a Database

Using SQLite for simplicity, let’s create a database and a table for NBA game stats:

```python
import sqlite3

db = sqlite3.connect("nba_data.db")
cursor = db.cursor()

cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS games (
    game_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    home_team TEXT,
    away_team TEXT,
    home_score INTEGER,
    away_score INTEGER,
    game_date TEXT
)
''')

db.commit()
```

### Inserting Data into the Database

Now, let's extract relevant information from the JSON response and store it:

```python
def save_game_data(data):
    for game in data['resultSets'][0]['rowSet']:
        game_id = game[2]
        home_team = game[5]
        away_team = game[6]
        home_score = game[21]
        away_score = game[22]
        game_date = params["GameDate"]

        cursor.execute('''
        INSERT INTO games (game_id, home_team, away_team, home_score, away_score, game_date)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)''',
        (game_id, home_team, away_team, home_score, away_score, game_date))

    db.commit()

save_game_data(data)
```

This function extracts relevant game details and saves them to the **SQLite database**.

## Querying and Using the Data

Once stored, we can retrieve and analyze the data easily:

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM games")
rows = cursor.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)
```

## Conclusion

Scraping and storing **NBA.com API** data allows us to analyze player stats, game outcomes, and team performances efficiently. 

By combining **Python** with **SQLite/PostgreSQL**, we can build a robust data pipeline for basketball analytics.

This foundation opens the door to deeper insights, such as player efficiency ratings, team trends, and predictive modeling for upcoming games.

For those passionate about sports data, mastering **data scraping and storage** is a game-changer in analytics!

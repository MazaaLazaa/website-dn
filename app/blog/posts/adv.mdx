Traditional NBA statistics like points per game (PPG) and rebounds per game (RPG) offer valuable insights, but they often fail to capture the full impact of a player's contribution. **Advanced metrics** such as **Player Efficiency Rating (PER)** and **Win Shares (WS)** provide a more holistic view of player performance. In this article, we'll break down these two advanced statistics, explain how they are calculated, and analyze their significance.

## **What is Player Efficiency Rating (PER)?**
PER is an advanced stat developed by John Hollinger to summarize a player's productivity in a single number.

### **How PER is Calculated**
The PER formula considers various factors like:
- Field goals, free throws, and three-pointers made
- Assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks
- Turnovers and personal fouls

It normalizes the result so that **league average PER is always 15**.

### **Strengths of PER**
✔ **Comprehensive**: Captures many aspects of a player's performance.  
✔ **Contextualized**: Adjusts for pace and minutes played.

### **Limitations of PER**
❌ **Overvalues Scoring**: Players who take a high volume of shots may have inflated PER.  
❌ **Ignores Defense**: Defensive impact isn't fully accounted for.

## **What are Win Shares (WS)?**
Win Shares is a statistic that estimates the number of **team wins** a player contributes to.

### **How WS is Calculated**
WS is split into:
- **Offensive Win Shares (OWS)**: Contribution based on offensive performance.
- **Defensive Win Shares (DWS)**: Contribution based on defensive performance.

The sum of **OWS + DWS = Total Win Shares (WS)**.

### **Strengths of WS**
✔ **Team-Oriented**: Reflects how much a player impacts winning.  
✔ **Balanced**: Accounts for both offensive and defensive contributions.

### **Limitations of WS**
❌ **Dependent on Team Performance**: A great player on a bad team may have low WS.  
❌ **Lags Behind Real-Time Impact**: Not as useful for in-game decision-making.

## **Which Metric is Better?**
Both **PER and WS** are valuable in different contexts:
- **PER** is great for individual performance assessment.
- **WS** is useful for understanding **overall team impact**.

## **Conclusion**
Advanced NBA metrics like **PER and WS** give analysts a clearer picture of player value beyond basic stats. While no single stat is perfect, combining multiple metrics provides a more accurate representation of a player's contributions to winning.

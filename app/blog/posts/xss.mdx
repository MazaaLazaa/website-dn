Web applications are prime targets for security vulnerabilities like **SQL Injection (SQLi)** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. These attacks can compromise databases, steal user data, and disrupt services. In this guide, we’ll explore how to **prevent SQL Injection and XSS attacks** using best practices.

## **Understanding SQL Injection**
SQL Injection occurs when an attacker **injects malicious SQL queries** into input fields to manipulate a database.

### **How SQL Injection Works**
Example of a vulnerable SQL query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "' AND password = '" + passwordInput + "';
```
If an attacker enters **' OR '1'='1** as `userInput`, the query becomes:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '';
```
This grants unauthorized access to the entire database.

### **How to Prevent SQL Injection**
1. **Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)**:
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?", (username, password))
```
2. **Sanitize User Input** to remove unexpected characters.
3. **Use ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** frameworks like SQLAlchemy or Prisma to avoid raw queries.
4. **Limit Database Privileges** to prevent unauthorized access.

## **Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
XSS attacks inject malicious scripts into web pages that execute in a user’s browser.

### **Example of an XSS Attack**
If a website allows unsanitized user input:
```html
<input type="text" name="comment" value="<script>alert('Hacked!');</script>">
```
This script executes on every page load, affecting users.

### **How to Prevent XSS**
1. **Escape HTML Characters**:
```javascript
const safeInput = input.replace(/</g, "&lt;").replace(/>/g, "&gt;");
```
2. **Use Content Security Policy (CSP)** to block unauthorized scripts:
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self';">
```
3. **Sanitize Inputs** using libraries like DOMPurify for JavaScript.
4. **Validate User Input** before displaying it.

## **Conclusion**
Preventing SQL Injection and XSS is crucial for securing web applications. By using **prepared statements, sanitization, CSP, and input validation**, you can significantly reduce security risks. Stay proactive in securing your applications against these common vulnerabilities!
